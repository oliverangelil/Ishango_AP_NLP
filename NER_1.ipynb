    "        Amazon notes that Prime members will get early access to some of the Prime Day deals ahead of the rest of the consumer pack from from June 21.\\n\\nDeals will include discounts on Amazon’s own products — eg, a 55% discount on its own devices like the Echo Show 5 (2nd Gen), the Echo Show 5 (2nd Gen) Kids, the Kindle Paperwhite, and the Halo fitness band; as well as discounts on Fire TV-compatible sets from companies like Insignia, Toshiba, Panasonic, alongside Amazon’s own devices.\\n\\nOther offers Amazon is already announcing include 20% on some Amazon Fresh products and $10 credit for completing tasks like listening to a song, streaming a video, and borrowing a book in Prime services, and a chance to win prizes for shopping from small businesses.\\n\\nIt also uses the event to try out some other selling formats.\\n\\nStarting June 21, Amazon will broadcast live shopping with celebrities/ like Porsha Williams, Joe and Frank Mele, and Hilary Duff on its website, shopping app, and Fire TV. This follows on from last year, when Kristen Bell, Karamo Brown, and Mindy Kaling took part in live shopping during Prime Day.\\n\\nAnd it’s tapping into BNPL to get people clicking a little more. Fintech firm Affirm partnered with Amazon to offer Prime Members a Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) option to split their payments into three installments for purchases more than $50 made between June 28 and July 11. (As with other BNPL platforms, Affirm’s pitch is “interest free” payments.)\\n\\nAmazon stakes a lot on Prime Day for its bottom line. It said that last year, it sold more than 250 million items last year during the sales event, working out to gross merchandise volume of $9.54 billion. However, to put that into some context, analysts pointed out that yearly growth was low. Part of that is simply the outsized lift that Covid-19 buying patterns provided, followed by the inevitable return to earth: In 2020, Amazon saw a 54% year-on-year bump in sales for Prime Day, but that figure shrunk to ‘just’ 7% growth in 2021.\\n\\nGiven inflation and the larger pressures we are seeing on consumer spending in the U.S. and elsewhere, it will be interesting to see what 2022 will hold in that context.\\n\\nSomething also to watch: this is the company’s first Prime Day after its founder Jeff Bezos stepped down from the CEO position last year. All eyes will be on whether current CEO Andy Jassy will deliver the goods, so to speak.\\n\\nHe’s definitely on the move with changes: in the last few months, Amazon has raised the prices of its Prime Service from $12.99 to $14.99 per month, started an invite-only ordering system for items like PlayStation 5 and Xbox, started testing an AR shopping experience, and promised to start a drone delivery system in California later this year.\\n\\nNevertheless, the company hasn’t had the greatest year so far, reporting a $3.84 billion loss in its first quarter results, with estimates of $116 billion to $121 billion for Q2 sales, coming in below analysts’ expectation of $125.5 billion. At the time of writing, Amazon’s stock is trading more than 36% down over a year ago. Amazon is also trying to deal with issues like fake reviews and counterfeit products on its platform.\\n\\nA new report from eMarketer suggests that the US e-commerce market will cross the mark of $1 trillion. However, for the first time, Amazon will see its market share shrink ever so slightly: down to 37.8% from 38% previously. Considering how much rests these days on market chatter, Prime Day results could be the difference between whether Amazon sinks or floats on those words.'}, '741d07a8-a02a-489e-8926-52584e29d1e1': {'date': '2022-06-08T00:00:00', 'mainArticle': 'After four clubs were banned for life from the fourth tier of South African football after fixing games in a bid to win the league, authorities have lined up a series of workshops to educate coaches, officials and referees.\\n\\nFor as table-topping rivals Matiyasi FC and Shivulani Dangerous Tigers battled for the title last month, so some extraordinary scorelines emerged.\\n\\nThe Tigers beat Kotoko Happy Boys 33-1 in late May, only for Matiyasi to improve on this with an eye-popping 59-1 victory over third-placed Nsami Mighty Birds.\\n\\nOfficials from the clubs have received suspensions of between five and eight seasons for their roles in fixing the games on 22 May, while the respective match officials have been given ten-season bans.\\n\\n\"These people don\\'t have respect for football, and we cannot allow it to happen again,\" Vincent Ramphago, president of the Mopani region, told BBC Sport Africa.\\n\\n\"What is sad is there are young players involved because the competition rules stipulate that each team has to field at least five players under 21.\\n\\n\"Our main aim in organising leagues is to make sure we groom the young footballers into potential future Bafana Bafana players.\"\\n\\nDespite their efforts, the goals ultimately counted for little however, as Gawula Classic - who finished fourth in the league - were declared winners of South Africa\\'s Mopani region.\\n\\nThese came after the bans handed out to the three teams above them, with Shivulani having led by three points, not to mention being 16 goals ahead on goal difference, prior to kick-off of the final day.\\n\\n\"Our investigation found that Matiyasi and Nsami wanted to stop Shivulani from topping the log so they agreed on fixing the match to prevent this from happening,\" stated Ramphago.\\n\\n\"After hearing that Matiyasi were leading 22-0 at half-time, Shivulani colluded to remove Kotoko Happy Boys players from the field.

With the public — and now startup — markets in turmoil, board members who may have gotten along swimmingly in the longest bull market in history may suddenly find themselves at odds with the management teams they’ve funded, as well as their fellow board members. After all, hard decisions are being made right now, and faced with very different financial pressures, many VCs are discovering their jobs just became a lot more challenging, too.\\n\\nWe talked with Feld last week about the book and the challenges currently facing startup boards, and we touched on a wide number of issues, from the importance (or not) of having an odd number of directors to avoid gridlock, and why every startup board should have independent directors from nearly the get-go. You can listen to our conversation here; meanwhile, we hope you’ll find the excerpts below, edited for length and clarity, helpful.\\n\\nTC: Why rework and republish this book? Why do startups need it?\\n\\nBF: One reason is until recently, we’ve had this incredible, positive market for entrepreneurship and venture specifically where there’s been huge value created [notwithstanding a] handful of cases where there’s been really bad governance that resulted in the cataclysmic failures of companies. At the same time, there’s been this narrative, especially amongst companies, that they don’t really need boards, [with] more entrepreneurs not taking advantage of the benefit of a board — especially outside board members.\\n\\nThis whole notion of what role a board really plays and how it can be helpful to a fast-growing company wasn’t just lost but in a lot of ways was being ignored.\\n\\nTC: Isn’t that also the fault of VCs who’ve been writing more checks, faster, and investing less in their board roles?\\n\\nBF: Absolutely. There is no question that part of it was VCs being overloaded with boards, or, in some cases, not even really understanding what their role is, because you had a lot of VC board members without a lot of board experience prior to [jumping into VC].\\n\\n[Part of it] . . . .tied to founder-controlled boards, where the founders have super voting rights, or the founders don’t really have a responsibility to a board per se. So you had some of that.\\n\\nYou also had a lot of investors, especially in the last couple of years, who put big checks into companies but didn’t take board seats.\\n\\nBut I think on top of all of that — a piece that’s missing from this part of the narrative — is that the most impactful part of boards, especially in fast-growing and mid-stage companies, are outside directors. Over many, many years, I’ve experienced huge value from outside directors at early stages, especially with first-time entrepreneurs, but also with experienced entrepreneurs, who can augment certain areas of expertise that they are lacking with another CEO on their board. They also hear things from that peer differently than they hear it from their VC investor.\\n\\nTC: When should startup founders start thinking about bringing aboard independent directors?\\n\\nMy [coauthor and serial entrepreneur] Matt Blumberg has something he calls the rule of one. His view is that at every financing round, if you add a VC to your board, you should always add an outside director, too. So if you start off with two founders, and they each have a board seat and you add a VC and the VC takes a board seat, you should add an outside director at that stage. If you do another round and another VC takes a board seat, you should add a second independent director at that stage. [Meanwhile], it blows my mind, the number of times that there’s an outside board member seat that’s empty when I am investing in a company at a Series A or even a Series B stage and there is already a VC on the board.\\n\\nTC: Because founders aren’t aware they should be doing this? Because VCs don’t want them adding to the board too fast?\\n\\nBF: A lot of times, the VCs will structure the board so that there’s an independent director. That’s pretty common. But no one prioritizes it. And it’s especially important in the kind of cycle we’re about to go through, one that I expect will be prolonged.\\n\\nIf you have situations where you have down rounds, you have recapitalizations, you have sales of companies below the liquidation preference — even if you’re dealing with something as simple as inside rounds — from a governance perspective, having an independent director on the board is a very significant positive governance characteristic.\\n\\nThere are lots of cases where it’s a ‘nice to have.’ There are some cases where, if you don’t have it, you actually create a real problem for yourself in terms of the downstream legal dynamics around things like the business judgment rule, and what you can rely on in those kinds of financings.\\n\\nAnd that’s independent from the benefits of an independent director [when it comes to] governance in a down round, because a lot of times in a down round, you get a lot of challenges between the founders and the investors, and you may have conflict between investors and investors. If you have somebody or multiple people in independent seats, they can play a very different role when emotions flare, or when there’s real tension, or when there’s real animosity between people because they have different incentives.\\n\\nI know plenty of founders who are good at navigating that. I know plenty of VCs who are good at navigating that. I know many more VCs who are not good at navigating it. I know many more founders who are not good at navigating that. It gets hard. And when you have a couple more people sitting around the board table who don’t get wrapped up in all of those emotional dynamics, it often makes for much better discussion and far better decisions.'}, 'd2f54944-bc42-471a-a894-3cee8e2979ee': {'date': '2022-06-13T03:04:13+00:00', 'mainArticle': 'Celsius Network, one of the biggest crypto lenders, told customers Sunday evening that it is pausing withdrawals, swap and transfers between accounts in a move that has sparked discussions and prompted the price of the firm’s token to take a 60% tumble in the past hour to as low as 19 cents.\\n\\n“We are taking this action today to put Celsius in a better position to honor, over time, its withdrawal obligations,” wrote Celsius, which counts stablecoin-issuer Tether International, growth equity fund WestCap Group and Canadian pension fund Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec among its investors.\\n\\n“Acting in the interest of our community is our top priority. In service of that commitment and to adhere to our risk management framework, we have activated a clause in our Terms of Use that will allow for this process to take place. Celsius has valuable assets and we are working diligently to meet our obligations.”\\n\\nCelsius, which was valued at $3.25 billion when it extended its “oversubscribed” Series B financing round to $750 million in November, allows users to deposit their Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tether and receive weekly interest payments. Depending on the time horizon and the token, the platform offers as much as 18% interest a year. On its website, Celsius says 1.7 million people call “Celsius their home for crypto.”\\n\\nThe announcement follows a brutal weekend in the cryptocurrency market that saw hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of liquidation. At the time of publication, Bitcoin was trading at about $25,585 and Ethereum at $1,346, some of their lowest levels in over a year. Other high-profile crypto projects, including Solana, BNB and FTT, were also down.\\n\\nThere must be many users who are in a position of leverage and desperately need those funds from Celsius, now locked away. I’m sad we’ve gotten here. Protect yourselves.\\n\\n— Ledger 🇺🇸 Prometheus of the Plebs (@ledgerstatus) June 13, 2022\\n\\nCrypto lenders are facing increased scrutiny following the collapse of Terraform Labs’ Luna and its sister token UST last month. Alex Mashinsky, chief executive of Celsius Network, has been trying to reassure customers in recent weeks, saying that they can withdraw their assets at any time, and questioned skeptics. The firm also launched a recurring promotion recently, offering customers rewards if they transferred assets into Celsius accounts and held positions for up to 180 days.\\n\\n“The beauty of what Celsius managed to do is that we deliver yield, we pay it to the people who would never be able to do it themselves, we take it from the rich, and we beat the index. That’s like going to the Olympics and getting 15 medals in 15 different fields,” Mashinsky said in a video streamed in December.\n",

Over many, many years, I’ve experienced huge value from outside directors at early stages, especially with first-time entrepreneurs, but also with experienced entrepreneurs, who can augment certain areas of expertise that they are lacking with another CEO on their board.

      "My [coauthor and serial entrepreneur] Matt Blumberg has something he calls the rule of one. His view is that at every financing round, if you add a VC to your board, you should always add an outside director, too. So if you start off with two founders, and they each have a board seat and you add a VC and the VC takes a board seat, you should add an outside director at that stage. If you do another round and another VC takes a board seat, you should add a second independent director at that stage. [Meanwhile], it blows my mind, the number of times that there’s an outside board member seat that’s empty when I am investing in a company at a Series A or even a Series B stage and there is already a VC on the board.\n",

      "TC: Because founders aren’t aware they should be doing this? Because VCs don’t want them adding to the board too fast?\n",
      "\n",
      "BF: A lot of times, the VCs will structure the board so that there’s an independent director. That’s pretty common. But no one prioritizes it. And it’s especially important in the kind of cycle we’re about to go through, one that I expect will be prolonged.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have situations where you have down rounds, you have recapitalizations, you have sales of companies below the liquidation preference — even if you’re dealing with something as simple as inside rounds — from a governance perspective, having an independent director on the board is a very significant positive governance characteristic.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are lots of cases where it’s a ‘nice to have.’ There are some cases where, if you don’t have it, you actually create a real problem for yourself in terms of the downstream legal dynamics around things like the business judgment rule, and what you can rely on in those kinds of financings.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that’s independent from the benefits of an independent director [when it comes to] governance in a down round, because a lot of times in a down round, you get a lot of challenges between the founders and the investors, and you may have conflict between investors and investors. If you have somebody or multiple people in independent seats, they can play a very different role when emotions flare, or when there’s real tension, or when there’s real animosity between people because they have different incentives.\n",

And when you have a couple more people sitting around the board table who don’t get wrapped up in all of those emotional dynamics, it often makes for much better discussion and far better decisions.'}, 'd2f54944-bc42-471a-a894-3cee8e2979ee': {'date': '2022-06-13T03:04:13+00:00', 'mainArticle': 'Celsius Network, one of the biggest crypto lenders, told customers Sunday evening that it is pausing withdrawals, swap and transfers between accounts in a move that has sparked discussions and prompted the price of the firm’s token to take a 60% tumble in the past hour to as low as 19 cents.\n",

      "Instagram announced today it will begin testing a new version of its full-screen feed, similar to TikTok’s, which aims to improve upon the way photos appear in this new format. The company said it will also use this experiment to try out changes to the navigation bar at the bottom of the Instagram app, where it will soon add shortcuts for creating a post and accessing messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you may recall, Instagram had somewhat controversially relocated its Compose button back in 2020 when it gave the prime spot in the center of the navigation bar to Reels. The Compose button was then tucked away in the top-right corner of the app. The choice may have benefited Instagram by driving users to Reels — if only by accident, in some cases — but it may have disincentivized users from creating a quick post. The fact that Instagram says it will now test bringing the button back to the navigation bar could signal that it’s seeing a decline in new content creation as more people shift their time and energy to TikTok.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the full-screen feed, Instagram had begun a similar experiment in May where it was soon met with user complaints and negative feedback. In addition to hiding away captions and comments, the updated format displayed all content in a 9:16 aspect ratio — including Instagram’s classic square photos and horizontal images. For those photos that didn’t properly fit the feed, Instagram applied a blurred, gradient border to make them blend in. Needless to say, many Instagram users were not fond of this change — and explained why in their replies to Instagram head Adam Mosseri’s posts about the update.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another issue with the earlier test was how the feed included odd white space in between posts. This made the feed appear to be something of a cross between TikTok’s true full-screen feed and a more traditional, card-style feed where posts were separated. Users also said the new format made their feed seem more cluttered as a result. Instagram has now clarified to TechCrunch that the new full-screen feed test rolling out will no longer show white space on the top and bottom of posts when viewing 9:16 videos.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the new feed holds some promise for creators, as Instagram said it would begin recommending their content to users who don’t follow them — similar to how TikTok throws in content it thinks you might like on its For You page. It’s also arguably helpful to professional creators and advertisers when different apps standardize around one format, as it allows content to more easily be reused across platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The changes were announced on Instagram by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who expressed that “photos are still an important part of Instagram” — a comment meant to address the backlash from those who use Instagram primarily for photography and who now believe Instagram no longer values their contributions amid its desperation to clone TikTok and shift users to video.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zuckerberg’s post also said Instagram was working on ways to improve the way photos showed up in this full-screen feed and some users would see the test come to the app soon. He didn’t elaborate on what, specifically, Instagram was doing to address users’ concerns.\n",
